# Objective

We've seen lot of health management systems out there but each of this system focus on one aspect of health. Some focus on hospitals or pharmaceuticals or laboratory but our focusa and objective is to bring all medical practitioners together as one.

# Our System

Like we said earlier in our objective, we aim to achieve the goal of building a system that allow end user (Patient) to have access to whichever medical service they want on one platform. Also, the awesomeness of our system is the inter-connection feature between all the medical practitioner which means a patience can have a medical test in a laboratory in one state and have the result viewed by his/her trusted hospital probably in another state on one platform.
